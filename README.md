## Project Setup

Node.js, MongoDB, and Postman can be used to create a Task-manager backend, which allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks. Here's how you can create a Task-manager backend using these technologies:

First, create a MongoDB database to store task information, including task description, completion status, and due date.

Implement CRUD endpoints in your Node.js backend to allow users to create, read, update, and delete tasks. Use the mongoose library to interact with the MongoDB database.

Use Postman to test your endpoints by sending requests with various parameters and checking the responses.

Set up a .env file in your project's root directory and add the MONGO_URI variable with your MongoDB connection string. This will allow your Node.js backend to connect to the database.

Implement user authentication and authorization checks in your Node.js backend to ensure that only authenticated and authorized users can access the task manager.

Use the jsonwebtoken library to implement JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and authorization. This will allow users to log in and receive a JWT, which they can use to access the task manager.

Add error handling to your Node.js backend to handle any errors that may occur during task creation, updating, or deletion.

By using Node.js, MongoDB, and Postman, you can create a robust and scalable Task-manager backend that allows users to manage their tasks with ease. Don't forget to set up the .env file with the MONGO_URI variable to connect to the database.
